## My process

### Built with

I built this project with...

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/) - For the font

### What I learned

I learnt to take note of the fact that 'querySelectorAll' returns a nodelist and to be able to differentiate nodelists from other iterables and the fact that you cannot add an event listener on a nodelist but on the elements in the nodelist. This was from this code üëáüèº

```js
btnRate.forEach(function (el) {
  el.addEventListener("click", function () {
    el.classList.toggle("btn--special");

    scoreBoard.textContent = `You selected ${el.innerHTML} out of 5`;
  });
});
```

I also learnt how to reload the document programmatically after pressing a key. This was from this code üëáüèº

```js
document.location.reload();
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally the concept of nodelist. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29884654/button-that-refreshes-the-page-on-click) - This helped me on how to reload a document (please note that for a page, you use 'window.' and for the entire document, you use 'document.')
